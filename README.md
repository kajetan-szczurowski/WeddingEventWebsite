# My event wedding website

## About

I created this website to provide guests with information about my wedding. 

The website contains information on:

- event plan,
- food at the event,
- travel options,
- our gift preferences,
- guest book management,
- contact options with the bride and groom.

### Language
All my wedding guests speak Polish, so the content of the website is in Polish, not English.

## Design 

The project assumed that the website would be made in a minimal style. White background and black text. In the wide screen version, the color burgundy appears as a highlight of the elements. In the small screen version, burgundy is the background of the navigation field.

## Tech Stack

The website was created in Astro, most of its components use basic functionalities. The only exception to this rule is the countdown component. I used React JS to implement it.

## Demo version
